# Hangman Game

This Hangman game is a simple Python project where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word. The game randomly selects a word from predefined categories, and the player has a limited number of chances to guess the correct letters.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3 recommended).
3. Run the game by executing the `hangman.py` script.

## How to Play

1. Run the game using the following command:
```powershell
python hangman code.py
```
2. Choose a subject category (Provinces of Iran, games, food, or animals).
3. The game will randomly select a word from the chosen category.
4. Guess a character. If it's correct, it will be revealed in the word. If not, you'll lose a chance.
5. Keep guessing until you either complete the word or run out of chances.
6. Enjoy the game!
